A VSCode extension designed with the intent of implementing syntax highlighting support for the DucklingScript Language.

DucklingScript is a language that ccompiles down into Rubber Ducky 1.0, adding important programmatic features. 

Further documentation for the language can be found [here](https://ducklingscript.dragonofshuu.dev).

## Installation

[**Install through the Visual Studio Code Marketplace**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DragonofShuu.ducklingscript-language-support)

To use the extension, simply create a `.dkls` file, and syntax highlighting will instantly appear!

## Features ‚ú®
### Type Safety ‚úîÔ∏è
With our professional quackers already compiling each line, DucklingScript preemptively validates your code will work for your hardware. And if there are any errors they'll helpfully point out where and why!

### Flow Control üåä
While the Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0 and even the Flipper's implementation don't add any flow control, our feathered friends give you the power to swim back around with the implementation of if statements, for/while loops, breakloop, and more!

### Syntactical Speed üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è
When working with Rubber Ducky 1.0 you might find yourself constantly laying the same eggs, but with DucklingScript we've added many commands to cut down on repetition in code and even made some syntax changes to help you type less to do more! [Check it out!](https://ducklingscript.dragonofshuu.dev/docs/category/learning-to-swim)

### Forward Compatability üîÆ
New command in Rubber Ducky that DucklingScript doesn't cover? No problem! Instead of throwing a fit about it, our quack team will simply let you know, which means you can use what you want, when you want; even if we're not sure what it is! Better still, if having our ducks notify you is ruffling your feathers you can simply ask them to stop by switching off the warnings in the config file!

### Familar Integration 

If you're used to using [Rubber Ducky Scripting Language 1.0](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816200129/http://github.com/hak5darren/USB-Rubber-Ducky/wiki/Duckyscript) or [Flipper Zero's BadUsb ducky extension](https://docs.flipper.net/bad-usb) you'll feel right at home with [DucklingScript](https://github.com/DragonOfShuu/DucklingScript) as we integrate the syntax from both languages and build on it further to help you get the results you want with the code you know.
